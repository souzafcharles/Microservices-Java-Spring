# Microservices with Java Spring and RabbitMQ

▶️ Project developed based on tutorials by **Michelli Brito** - [Decoder](https://www.michellibrito.com/).
***
## Overview  
Microservices architecture is a widely adopted approach in modern software development, enabling scalable and maintainable applications. This tutorial examines the implementation of two microservices:  

- [User Microservice](https://github.com/souzafcharles/Microservices-Java-Spring/tree/main/user)  
- [Email Microservice](https://github.com/souzafcharles/Microservices-Java-Spring/tree/main/email)   

The system employs **RabbitMQ messaging** for asynchronous communication between services, ensuring efficient data exchange and decoupled processing. Additionally, the project incorporates:  

- **Email delivery via Gmail SMTP;**  
- **Key microservice development concepts**, including:  
  - Service isolation;  
  - Messaging patterns;  
  - Integration techniques.  

This resource provides a practical guide for developers who want to:  
- Learn about and implement **microservices architecture** using Spring Boot;
- Use **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous, message-driven communication; and
- Integrate **email capabilities** effectively within their microservices.
